# Road to Frontend: Challenge #1 - TriquiCool ðŸ˜Ž
**Â¡The Ingeniera Y. Torres, AKA [pollencio](https://github.com/pollencio) has spoken!** Only those who have at least 1 million lines of JS code uploaded to Github will be able to apply for a Junior Frontend developer job. Â¡So be it! 

## Getting confidence combining HTML and CSS with JS
My first challenge: make my own version from scratch using HTML, CSS and JS of the famous game known by english language speakers as Tic Tac Toe (Triqui, tres en raya in spanish, etc). Nothing fancy, but with style :D
